Before this we would just let the single thread die, and the internal topic creation/validation would be retried on the subsequent rebalance.

The comment says things here depend on initiated SharedStoreManager. That statement is incomplete. It is that plus the CoreContainer#sharedStoreManager is initialized because CorePullerFeeder depends on that. Also blobCoreSyncer and blobProcessUtil are two fields that are not initialized yet. The comment suggests all the public facing fields would have been initialized by now. Even if that is not what the comment means, there is nothing preventing them from being accessed in null state. The other problem is that if the CoreContainer#load fails then CoreContainer@shutdown is called for cleanup. At least inside CoreContainer#createAndLoad. That can hit an NPE when calling sharedStoreManager.getBlobProcessManager().shutdown() because it is possible the exception that started the shutdown was in sharedStoreManager#load before blobProcessUtil was even initialized. The second problem can be solved by creating a shutdown method inside SharedStoreManager and moving  sharedStoreManager.getBlobProcessManager().shutdown() there, protected by blobProcessUtil!= null check.

What ends up happening is that the error gets logged here and then later on by the caller, generating extra logs and confusing the user. Instead, you can wrap the exception with a more specific error message and propagate it up. Something like: throw new IllegalArgumentException("...", e);  The message should also give more information to the user about what they should do to fix the problem. This particular case can only happen when the format was a macro, otherwise it would have caused an error in configurePipeline. So a better message would be: Format '{}' cannot be used because properties {} were not provided or were invalid when the pipeline was deployed. Set the format to a different value, or re-create the pipeline with all required properties.

So those UIPlugin classes are actually somehow related to the rendered application components and widgets, but clearly the XML Validator and the rest of the XML processing stuff I'm using here are not. And yet, the JMC code pathway for processing XML calls into UI components simply for the purpose of reusing their static logger instance... A fix for this is probably going to take a while to make it into a snapshot release version so I'll have to rely on this hack for a while, but if any portion of this XML stuff can be cleaned up and moved into jmc-core, then it would be really nice and useful for us to use here in container-jfr(-core).

Since ArtifactService is bound to a DatabaseClient, storing this as a field binds this class to a DatabaseClient, and thus to a single user. That's the main problem with all the DHF Service/Manager classes - they have HubConfig as a field, and thus they're bound to a single user. If the intent was for Service/Manager classes to be Spring-managed singletons, they should be stateless / threadsafe classes. That's unfortunately not the case, due to the HubConfig field. Ideally, HubConfig - or some subset of it - would be passed in as an argument to methods that need it.

Is there other places in the code that perform the same logic? Then I investigated a little and it seems that this is over-engineered. The list of TransitAlert.entities is always filtered down to a specific type - So maybe just keeping a set of Selectors for each type is sufficient. The selectors do not select anything - they are just a placeholder witch reference a type(inderect) and one or two ids. It toke me a while before I got that. Or am I missing something?

What do you think of using the pbj parameter? Using it offers a big advantage: it's a JSON formatted response which is, as you might've imagine, much less error prone to parse (it is basically the initialData already extracted). Another thing is that the size would be as tiny, or even tinier than it was, a gziped 15~20KB response. Here's an example using the /videos endpoint (could be another one as well or even the "root", but this one seems to be sufficient to parse all the things we need, like description, name, etc.): curl 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLA_DiR1FfKNvjuUpBHmylQ/videos?pbj=1' \     -H 'x-youtube-client-name: 1' -H 'x-youtube-client-version: 2.20200224.11.00' \     -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0' \     -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' --compressed -v | jq > videos.pbj1.json It looks like the only headers that we need are those two, which maybe we can just hardcode it (who knows how long it remains valid) or even find some lightweight method to get it dynamically. I'll investigate more about it later. PS: This is used throughout YouTube, replacing the channel with a video url works like a charm. Worth investigating as well.	Code	No	FALSE

And luckily there is already a built-in DateTimeFormatter constant that has the format you want here.  One of SimpleDateFormat's problems is that it is mutable -- formatting a date modifies the SimpleDateFormat instance -- so you have to construct a new instance for each date like this.

As like toLogGroupName is doing. If toLogStreamName simply uses previousStatus.get("awslogs").get("awslogs-stream").asText() then, we can do as following: run calls createCurrentStatus to set awslogs to the status. It's calling getAwsLogsConfiguration(td), which copies all of the logConfig.getOptions().entrySet() to the executor status. This becomes unnecessary. Instead, it simply needs to copy awslogs.awslogs-group and format&set awslogs.awslogs-stream only. Because toLogStreamName gets pre-formatted text from the executor status, it doesn't need TaskDefinition td any more. It also means that fetchLogEvents doesn't need Task task. It means that createNextCommandStatus doesn't have to pass Task task to fetchLogEvents. Therefore, you can move this entire block (if (taskFinishedAt.isPresent()) { ... }) right before client.getTask call. It means that EcsCommandExecutor doesn't have to call ECS API when it's waiting for logs.  This is helpful to mitigate API call rate limit of ECS API.	Code	No	FALSE

As we are do a major refactor, let us take this opportunity to get rid of the "default range" and use a range selector. In the MacRangeRepository or a new repository, create a table to track the utilization of each range. Option 1 Explicit update: Every allocation request always goes to that table to pick up the latest range with least utilization,  and increment the count after an allocation request or decrease the count after a release request. This option is easy to implement at a cost of write performance (more DB access!). Option 2 In-Memory Counter with Background Monitoring: Each Mac Manager Instance has an in-memory counter that tracks the utilization of each range. The counter gets updated by a running monitoring thread in a periodic manner. This thread should run not very frequently, say every 30 minutes or so, and keep the counter always up-to-date. The allocation/release request only needs to read the in-memory counter but no obligation to update it. NOTE that when every Mac Manager instance launches or restart, it also needs to initialize its in-memory counter.	Code	No	FALSE

Given that GT doesn't necessarily support the full set of expressions, this distinction is relevant, because the invalid and not supported have different fixes - and invalid expression is user error (most likely a misspelling), and should be simple to fix, whereas an expression that is not supported means they need to upgrade (or wait for) a version of geotools that supports the expression. Unfortunately I don't think there's much we can do about this - even if we maintained a list of expressions that GT didn't yet support, it would inevitably become outdated.

Obviously the API of the PropertyMapping gets a little bit vague here. Most code assumes that properties in the PropertyMapping are actually deducible from just the association owners subclass column span, which nullable properties are inherently not. In that sense, it doesn't make sense for the property to be considered here. As far as I remember, this was at least how these were handled at the time I wrote this originally. It might have changed since, or I might just as well have simply overlooked this case. Anyways, I expected joinIsNeeded for generateJoin && entityType.isNullable - so nothing worries me here.

At the end of the day both options open the same activity, even though the outcome is different, so I think users would expect "Show info" to be selected in the dialog if they had used the "Video player" choice before disabling autoplay, and viceversa. I don't think you would need to do anything else in order to achieve what I described above, since VideoDetailFragment already handles autoplay by itself.	Code	No	FALSE
